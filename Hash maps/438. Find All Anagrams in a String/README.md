# Question number: [438](https://leetcode.com/problems/find-all-anagrams-in-a-string/)

## Difficulty: Medium
Given two strings s and p, return an array of all the start indices of p's anagrams in s. You may return the answer in any order.

An Anagram is a word or phrase formed by rearranging the letters of a different word or phrase, typically using all the original letters exactly once.

## Example 1:
Input: s = "cbaebabacd", p = "abc"

Output: [0,6]

Explanation:

The substring with start index = 0 is "cba", which is an anagram of "abc".

The substring with start index = 6 is "bac", which is an anagram of "abc".

## Constraints:

1 <= s.length, p.length <= 3 * 10<sup>4</sup>

s and p consist of lowercase English letters.
