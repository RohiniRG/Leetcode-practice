# Question number: [9](https://leetcode.com/problems/palindrome-number/)

## Difficulty: Easy
Given an integer x, return true if x is palindrome integer.

An integer is a palindrome when it reads the same backward as forward.

For example, 121 is a palindrome while 123 is not.

## Example 1:
Input: x = 121

Output: true

Explanation: 121 reads as 121 from left to right and from right to left.

## Example 2:
Input: x = -121

Output: false

Explanation: From left to right, it reads -121. From right to left, it becomes 121-. Therefore it is not a palindrome.

## Constraints:
-2<sup>31</sup> <= x <= 2<sup>31</sup>  - 1

## Submission details:
