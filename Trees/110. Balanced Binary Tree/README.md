# Question number: [110](https://leetcode.com/problems/balanced-binary-tree/)

## Difficulty: Easy
Given a binary tree, determine if it is height-balanced.

For this problem, a height-balanced binary tree is defined as: 
a binary tree in which the left and right subtrees of every node differ in height by no more than 1.

## Example 1:
Input: root = [3,9,20,null,null,15,7]

Output: true

## Example 2:
Input: root = [1,2,2,3,3,null,null,4,4]

Output: false

## Constraints:
The number of nodes in the tree is in the range [0, 5000].

-10<sup>4</sup> <= Node.val <= 10<sup>4</sup>
