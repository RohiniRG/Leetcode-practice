# Question number: [103](https://leetcode.com/problems/binary-tree-zigzag-level-order-traversal/)

## Difficulty: Medium
Given the root of a binary tree, return the zigzag level order traversal of its nodes' values. (i.e., from left to right, then right to left for the next level and alternate between).

## Example 1:
Input: root = [3,9,20,null,null,15,7]

Output: [[3],[20,9],[15,7]]

## Constraints:

The number of nodes in the tree is in the range [0, 2000].

-100 <= Node.val <= 100
