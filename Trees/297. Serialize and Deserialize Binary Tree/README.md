# Question number: [297](https://leetcode.com/problems/serialize-and-deserialize-binary-tree/)

## Difficulty: Hard
Serialization is the process of converting a data structure or object into a sequence of bits so that it can be stored in a file or memory buffer, or transmitted across a network connection link to be reconstructed later in the same or another computer environment.

Design an algorithm to serialize and deserialize a binary tree. There is no restriction on how your serialization/deserialization algorithm should work. You just need to ensure that a binary tree can be serialized to a string and this string can be deserialized to the original tree structure.

## Example 1:
Input: root = [1,2,3,null,null,4,5]

Output: [1,2,3,null,null,4,5]

## Constraints:

The number of nodes in the tree is in the range [0, 10<sup>4</sup>]

-1000 <= Node.val <= 1000
