# Question number: [104](https://leetcode.com/problems/maximum-depth-of-binary-tree/)

## Difficulty: Easy
Given the root of a binary tree, return its maximum depth.
A binary tree's maximum depth is the number of nodes along the longest path from the root node down to the farthest leaf node.

## Example 1:

Input: root = [3,9,20,null,null,15,7]

Output: 3

## Example 2:

Input: root = [1,null,2]

Output: 2

## Constraints:

The number of nodes in the tree is in the range [0, 104]

-100 <= Node.val <= 100
