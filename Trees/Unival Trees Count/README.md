# [Question](https://www.codingninjas.com/codestudio/problems/unival-trees_697311)

## Difficulty: Easy
You are given a binary tree. Return the count of unival sub-trees in the given binary tree. In unival trees, all the nodes, below the root node, have the same value as the data of the root.
For example: for the binary tree, given in the following diagram, the number of unival trees is 5.

## Example 1:
Input: 1 1 1 -1 -1 -1 -1

Output: 3

## Example 2:

Input: 1 2 3 2 -1 3 4 -1 -1 3 3 -1 -1 -1 -1 -1 -1

Output: 6

## Constraints:
1 <= T <= 10

0 <= N <= 10<sup>5</sup>

0 <= data <= 10<sup>4</sup>, where data is the value for a node.
