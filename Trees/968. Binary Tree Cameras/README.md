# Question number: [968](https://leetcode.com/problems/binary-tree-cameras/)

## Difficulty: Hard
You are given the root of a binary tree. We install cameras on the tree nodes where each camera at a node can monitor its parent, itself, and its immediate children.

Return the minimum number of cameras needed to monitor all nodes of the tree.

## Example 1:
Input: root = [0,0,null,0,0]

Output: 1

Explanation: One camera is enough to monitor all nodes if placed as shown.

## Constraints:
The number of nodes in the tree is in the range [1, 1000].

Node.val == 0
