# Question number: [100](https://leetcode.com/problems/same-tree/)

## Difficulty: Easy
Given the roots of two binary trees p and q, write a function to check if they are the same or not.
Two binary trees are considered the same if they are structurally identical, and the nodes have the same value.

## Example 1:

Input: p = [1,2,3], q = [1,2,3]

Output: true

## Example 2:

Input: p = [1,2], q = [1,null,2]

Output: false

## Constraints:

The number of nodes in both trees is in the range [0, 100].

-10<sup>4</sup> <= Node.val <= 10<sup>4</sup>
