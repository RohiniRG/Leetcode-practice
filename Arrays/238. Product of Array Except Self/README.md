# Question number: [238](https://leetcode.com/problems/product-of-array-except-self/)

## Difficulty: Medium
Given an integer array nums, return an array answer such that answer[i] is equal to the product of all the elements of nums except nums[i].

The product of any prefix or suffix of nums is guaranteed to fit in a 32-bit integer.

You must write an algorithm that runs in O(n) time and without using the division operation.

## Example 1:
Input: nums = [1,2,3,4]

Output: [24,12,8,6]

## Constraints:
2 <= nums.length <= 10<sup>5</sup>

-30 <= nums[i] <= 30

The product of any prefix or suffix of nums is guaranteed to fit in a 32-bit integer.
