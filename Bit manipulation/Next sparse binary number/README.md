# [Question](https://practice.geeksforgeeks.org/problems/next-sparse-binary-number0029/1#)

## Difficulty: Hard
Given an integer n in the input, find its next sparse binary number.A sparse binary number is a number whose binary representation does not contain any consecutive 1s.

## Example 1:
Input: n = 3

Output: 4

Explanation: Binary representation of 4 is 0100.

## Example 2:
Input: n = 5

Output: 5

Explanation: Binary representation of 5 is 0101.

## Constraints:
1 <= n <= 10<sup>5</sup>
