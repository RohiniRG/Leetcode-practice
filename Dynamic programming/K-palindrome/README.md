## Difficulty: Medium
Given a string str of length n, find if the string is K-Palindrome or not. A k-palindrome string transforms into a palindrome on removing at most k characters from it.

## Example 1:
Input: str = "abcdecba", n = 8, k = 1

Output: 1

Explanation: By removing 'd' or 'e' we can make it a palindrome.

## Constraints:
1 ≤ n, k ≤ 10<sup>3</sup>
