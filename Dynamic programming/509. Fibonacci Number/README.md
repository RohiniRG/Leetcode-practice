# Question number: [509](https://leetcode.com/problems/fibonacci-number/)

## Difficulty: Easy
The Fibonacci numbers, commonly denoted F(n) form a sequence, called the Fibonacci sequence, such that each number is the sum of the two preceding ones, starting from 0 and 1. That is,
```
F(0) = 0, F(1) = 1
F(n) = F(n - 1) + F(n - 2), for n > 1.
Given n, calculate F(n).
```

## Example 1:
Input: n = 4

Output: 3

Explanation: F(4) = F(3) + F(2) = 2 + 1 = 3

## Constraints:
0 <= n <= 30
