# Question number: [121](https://leetcode.com/problems/best-time-to-buy-and-sell-stock/)

## Difficulty: Easy
You are given an array prices where prices[i] is the price of a given stock on the ith day.

You want to maximize your profit by choosing a single day to buy one stock and choosing a different day in the future to sell that stock.

Return the maximum profit you can achieve from this transaction. If you cannot achieve any profit, return 0.

## Example 1:
Input: prices = [7,1,5,3,6,4]

Output: 5

Explanation: Buy on day 2 (price = 1) and sell on day 5 (price = 6), profit = 6-1 = 5.
Note that buying on day 2 and selling on day 1 is not allowed because you must buy before you sell.

## Constraints:
1 <= prices.length <= 10<sup>5</sup>

0 <= prices[i] <= 10<sup>4</sup>
