# Question number: [1567](https://leetcode.com/problems/maximum-length-of-subarray-with-positive-product/)

## Difficulty: Medium
Given an array of integers nums, find the maximum length of a subarray where the product of all its elements is positive.

A subarray of an array is a consecutive sequence of zero or more values taken out of that array.

Return the maximum length of a subarray with positive product.

## Example 1:
Input: nums = [1,-2,-3,4]

Output: 4

Explanation: The array nums already has a positive product of 24.

## Constraints:
1 <= nums.length <= 10<sup>5</sup>
-109 <= nums[i] <= 10<sup>9</sup>
