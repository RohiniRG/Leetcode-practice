# Question number: [21](https://leetcode.com/problems/merge-two-sorted-lists/)

## Difficulty: Easy
Merge two sorted linked lists and return it as a sorted list. The list should be made by splicing together the nodes of the first two lists.

## Example 1:
Input: l1 = [1,2,4], l2 = [1,3,4]

Output: [1,1,2,3,4,4]

## Example 2:

Input: l1 = [], l2 = []

Output: []

## Constraints:

The number of nodes in both lists is in the range [0, 50].

-100 <= Node.val <= 100

Both l1 and l2 are sorted in non-decreasing order.
