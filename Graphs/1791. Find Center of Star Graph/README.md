# Question number: [1791](https://leetcode.com/problems/find-center-of-star-graph/)

## Difficulty: Easy
There is an undirected star graph consisting of n nodes labeled from 1 to n. A star graph is a graph where there is one center node and exactly n - 1 edges that connect the center node with every other node.

You are given a 2D integer array edges where each edges[i] = [ui, vi] indicates that there is an edge between the nodes ui and vi. Return the center of the given star graph.

## Example 1:

Input: edges = [[1,2],[2,3],[4,2]]

Output: 2

Explanation: As shown in the figure above, node 2 is connected to every other node, so 2 is the center.

## Example 2:

Input: edges = [[1,2],[5,1],[1,3],[1,4]]

Output: 1

## Constraints:

3 <= n <= 10<sup>5</sup>

edges.length == n - 1

edges[i].length == 2

1 <= ui, vi <= n, ui != vi

The given edges represent a valid star graph.
